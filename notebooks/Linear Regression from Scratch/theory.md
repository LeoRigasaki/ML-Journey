# Linear Regression: From Origins to Modern Applications

Linear regression is a foundational supervised learning algorithm in machine learning and data science. It's often the starting point for many entering the field. The term "linear" signifies that the relationship between variables is assumed to be representable by a straight line (or a higher-dimensional equivalent), while "regression" stems from the statistical concept of regression toward the mean.

## What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is used to predict a continuous output variable based on one or more input variables. It aims to find the best-fitting linear equation to describe the relationship between the independent variables (predictors or features) and the dependent variable (response variable). In essence, it helps determine:
*   If an independent variable is a good predictor of the dependent variable.
*   Which independent variables play a significant role in predicting the dependent variable.

### Historical Context
Linear regression originated from the work of **Francis Galton** in the late 19th century while studying the relationship between heights of parents and their children. Galton observed "regression toward mediocrity," where children of tall parents were generally less tall than their parents, leading to the development of regression analysis.

### Why Linear Regression?
Linear regression is crucial for several reasons:
*   It provides a straightforward way to understand relationships between variables.
*   It often performs well on real-world problems despite its simplicity.
*   It serves as a building block for more complex models, making it essential to master before moving to advanced techniques.

### Problem Statement
The provided sources consider the problem of predicting California housing prices. This involves predicting the median house values based on features such as:
*   Location (latitude, longitude)
*   Housing characteristics (number of rooms, bedrooms)
*   Population demographics
*   Income levels

This problem is well-suited for linear regression because:
1.  House prices often show linear relationships with certain features (like square footage or income levels).
2.  The output variable (house prices) is continuous and numerical.
3. The datasets are well-documented and clean.
4. The problem has real-world applications.

## Types of Linear Regression

There are two main types of linear regression:
*   **Simple Linear Regression**: This involves one independent variable and one dependent variable. The goal is to find the best-fitting line to describe the relationship between these two variables. The equation is typically represented as:
    *   y = b0 + b1 * x or y = mx + b
        *   where 'y' is the dependent variable, 'x' is the independent variable, 'b0' or 'b' is the intercept, and 'b1' or 'm' is the slope coefficient.
*   **Multiple Linear Regression**: This involves multiple independent variables and one dependent variable. The equation for multiple linear regression is:
    *   Y = b0 + b1 * X1 + b2 * X2 + ... + bn * Xn
        *   where Y is the dependent variable, X1, X2, ..., Xn are the independent variables, b0 is the intercept, and b1, b2, ..., bn are the slope coefficients.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Basic Concepts
1.  **Linear Function**: The core idea is that the target variable (y) can be approximated by a linear combination of input features:
    *   y ≈ w0 + w1x1 + w2x2 + ... + wnxn
        *   where w0 is the bias (intercept), w1...wn are the weights (coefficients), and x1...xn are the input features.
2.  **Cost Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is commonly used to measure prediction errors. The errors are squared because:
    *   It penalizes larger errors more heavily.
    *   It makes derivatives easier to compute.
    *   It ensures errors are always positive.
    The MSE is calculated as:
        *   J(w) = (1/2m) * Σ(hw(x(i)) - y(i))²
            *   where  `J(w)`  is the cost, `h_w(x^(i))`  is the predicted value, `y^(i)` is the actual value, and `m` is the number of data points.
3.  **Gradient Descent**: To minimize the cost function:
    *   Partial derivatives are taken with respect to each weight.
    *   Weights are updated in the opposite direction of the gradient.

The update rule is:
*   wj := wj - α * (1/m) * Σ(hw(x(i)) - y(i))xj(i)

    *   where  `α`  is the learning rate.

### Finding the Best Fit Line
The best-fitting line is found by minimizing the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS), which is the sum of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. This is achieved by adjusting the intercept and slope coefficients. The process used to achieve this is called **ordinary least squares (OLS) regression**. The most commonly used cost function for this is the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

### Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimise the cost function. It works by iteratively adjusting the values of the intercept and slope coefficients. The algorithm calculates the gradient of the cost function, which is the direction of the steepest descent, and updates the coefficients in the opposite direction of the gradient. The **learning rate** determines the size of the step taken in each iteration. The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialise the values of b0 and b1 to random values.
2. Calculate the predicted values using the current values of b0 and b1.
3. Calculate the cost function using the predicted and actual values.
4. Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to b0 and b1.
5. Update the values of b0 and b1 by taking a step in the opposite direction of the gradient, with the step size determined by the learning rate.
6. Repeat steps 2–5 until the cost function is minimised or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Assumptions of Linear Regression
Linear regression relies on several key assumptions:
*   **Linearity**: A linear relationship between independent features and the target variable.
*   **No Multicollinearity**: Little or no correlation between independent variables.
*   **No Autocorrelation**: Little or no correlation in the residuals, especially in time series data.
*   **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance in error terms across all values of the independent variables.
*   **Normality of Residuals**: Error terms should be normally distributed.

If these assumptions are not met, the accuracy of the model may be reduced. The Gauss-Markov theorem states that if the first six classical assumptions are met, then OLS regression produces unbiased estimates that have the smallest variance of all possible linear estimators.

## Implementation
### Using Scikit-learn
Multiple linear regression can be implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python:
1.  Import necessary modules (e.g., `LinearRegression`, `train_test_split`, `r2_score`)
2. Load data into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Separate independent variables (X) from the dependent variable (y).
4. Split data into training and testing sets.
5. Create a `LinearRegression` object and fit it to the training data.
6. Use the trained model to make predictions on the testing data and evaluate its performance using R-squared.
### Polynomial Regression
Polynomial regression extends linear regression by adding polynomial terms to the equation. This helps capture nonlinear relationships. The equation takes the form:
*   y = b0 + b1 * x + b2 * x² + ... + bn * x^n + e
    *   where 'n' is the degree of the polynomial.
    *  Polynomial regression can be implemented with scikit-learn by using the `PolynomialFeatures` class to transform the input data and then fitting a `LinearRegression` model.

## Model Performance
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as:
*   **Sum of Squares Regression (SSR)**:  The sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the mean of the dependent variable.
*   **Sum of Squares Error (SSE)**: The sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable.
*   **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
*   **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of the MSE.
*   **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values.
*  **Sum Of Squares Total (SST)**: The sum of the squared differences between the actual values of the dependent variable and its mean value.
*   **R-squared (R²)**: The proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable(s).

## Limitations and Challenges
### Model Limitations
*   **Linearity Assumption**: Real-world relationships might be non-linear.
    *   Solution: Feature engineering or non-linear models
*   **Feature Independence**: Assumes features are independent, while they often correlate (multicollinearity).
*   **Constant Variance (Homoscedasticity)**: Assumes error variance is constant, but this may not always hold.

### Implementation Challenges
*   **Feature Scaling**: Different features have different scales, requiring proper normalization/standardization.
*   **Outlier Sensitivity**: MSE heavily penalises outliers, necessitating robust preprocessing.
*   **Learning Rate Selection**: Too high a learning rate can lead to overshooting, while too low a learning rate can lead to slow convergence.

## Future Work
### Model Improvements
*   **Regularization**: Add L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) penalties to combat overfitting and for feature selection.
*   **Polynomial Features**: Capture non-linear relationships.
*   **Adaptive Learning Rates**: Implement momentum or optimisers such as AdaGrad or Adam.

### Application Extensions
*   **Real-time Price Updates**: Process streaming data and use online learning.
*   **Uncertainty Estimation**: Provide confidence and prediction intervals.
*   **Interpretability Tools**: Use feature importance analysis and partial dependence plots.

## Interpreting Regression Results
The quality of the linear regression model can be checked using the statsmodel package in Python and doing a `.summary()` on the model. This provides a variety of statistical tests, such as:
*   **Omnibus/Prob(Omnibus)**: Tests the skewness and kurtosis of the residual.
    *   Values close to 0 indicate normality.
*   **Skew**: Measures the symmetry of the data, where values closer to 0 indicate a normal residual distribution.
*   **Kurtosis**: Measures the tailedness of the data relative to a normal distribution.
*   **Durbin-Watson**: Detects autocorrelation in the residuals.
    *   A value of 2 means no autocorrelation.
*   **Jarque-Bera/Prob(Jarque-Bera)**:  Tests if the sample data has skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution.
*   **Condition Number**: Measures the sensitivity of a function’s output to its input, with lower numbers generally better.
*   **R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared**: Shown on the top right of the model summary, it is important to be familiar with these values to understand the variance.
