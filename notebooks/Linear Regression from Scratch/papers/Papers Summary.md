### 1. The Original Least Squares Method

**Paper**: "Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientium" by Carl Friedrich Gauss (1809)

**Summary**: In this work, Gauss introduced the method of least squares, a mathematical approach to minimize the sum of the squares of the differences between observed and calculated values. This method became fundamental in statistical regression analysis and is widely used for data fitting.

### 2. Ridge Regression

**Paper**: "Ridge Regression: Biased Estimation for Nonorthogonal Problems" by Arthur E. Hoerl and Robert W. Kennard (1970)

**Summary**: This paper addresses the issue of multicollinearity in multiple regression analysis, where predictor variables are highly correlated. The authors propose ridge regression, which introduces a bias into the regression estimates by adding a small positive constant to the diagonal of the correlation matrix. This technique stabilizes the estimates and often results in more reliable predictions.

### 3. LASSO Regression

**Paper**: "Regression Shrinkage and Selection via the Lasso" by Robert Tibshirani (1996)

**Summary**: Tibshirani introduces the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method, which performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of regression models. By imposing a constraint on the sum of the absolute values of the model parameters, LASSO effectively shrinks some coefficients to zero, thus selecting a simpler model.

### 4. Elastic Net

**Paper**: "Regularization and Variable Selection via the Elastic Net" by Hui Zou and Trevor Hastie (2005)

**Summary**: The authors propose the Elastic Net method, which combines the penalties of LASSO and ridge regression. This approach is particularly useful when the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations or when predictors are highly correlated. Elastic Net encourages a grouping effect, where correlated predictors tend to be selected together.
